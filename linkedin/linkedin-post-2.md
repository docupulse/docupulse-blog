## 💡 Did you know that professionals spend 40% of their time searching for and extracting data from documents?**

### The Real Numbers
- **Auditors:** 60+ hours per audit manually cross-referencing documents
- **Due Diligence Teams:** 3-4 weeks analyzing investment agreements for cap tables
- **Finance Teams:** 15+ hours monthly linking Excel reports to source documents

### The Hidden Costs
Beyond time, manual processes create:
❌ **Transcription errors** (5-10% error rate)
❌ **Incomplete analysis** (missing critical information)
❌ **Compliance risks** (broken audit trails)
❌ **Opportunity costs** (delayed decisions)
insights

### The Bottom Line
Manual document analysis isn't just inefficient — it's expensive, risky, and limits your team's potential.
