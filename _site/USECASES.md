The agent leverages advanced document processing, semantic search, and data extraction capabilities to automate complex financial analysis tasks across various document types including contracts, invoices, agreements, and due diligence materials.

---

# Agent Setup

## Agent Architecture Overview

The DocuPulse agent is designed to create comprehensive document summaries, densify information, and generate rich overviews for any document type. The agent assumes all documents are relevant and leverages Phi-4 SLM-generated metadata to create detailed, structured outputs.

### Core Agent Workflow

```
1. DOCUMENT ANALYSIS → 2. INFORMATION EXTRACTION → 3. STRUCTURED SUMMARIZATION → 4. RICH OUTPUT GENERATION
```

#### 1. **Document Analysis Phase**
- Analyzes document structure and content using Phi-4 SLM metadata
- Identifies key sections, data points, and information categories
- Creates comprehensive understanding of document content

#### 2. **Information Extraction Phase**
- Extracts all relevant information without missing details
- Categorizes information by type (financial, legal, technical, etc.)
- Identifies relationships between different data points

#### 3. **Structured Summarization Phase**
- Creates organized summaries with clear categorization
- Densifies information while maintaining completeness
- Structures data for optimal presentation

#### 4. **Rich Output Generation Phase**
- Generates comprehensive Excel outputs using Office.js JSONs
- Creates interactive overviews with proper formatting
- Ensures no information is lost in the final output

### Required Indexing Strategy Capabilities

#### **Enhanced Indexing with Azure Form Recognizer + Phi-4-mini-instruct**
The indexing strategy must be capable of:

1. **Systematic Chunking**
   - **Source**: Azure Form Recognizer output (already implemented in Enhanced Indexing Strategy)
   - **Method**: Get chunks systematically by paragraph using Azure Form Recognizer structure
   - **Overlap**: **NO OVERLAP** - chunks are discrete and non-overlapping
   - **Structure Awareness**: Respects Azure Form Recognizer's document structure

2. **Metadata Generation Pipeline**
   - **Hardcoded Information**: Use predefined rules and patterns
   - **Azure JSON Information**: Leverage Azure Form Recognizer's structured output
   - **Phi-4-mini-instruct**: Apply AI model to chunk content for enhanced metadata generation
   - **Combined Approach**: Merge hardcoded, Azure, and AI-generated metadata

3. **Chunk Metadata Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "chunk_id": "unique_identifier",
